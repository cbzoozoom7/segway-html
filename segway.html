			My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got
			everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway,
			I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me

				<li>
					cell phone

					iPod

			Just the essentials. As
			Lao Tzu would have said, <q>A journey of a
			thousand miles begins with one Segway.</q>
